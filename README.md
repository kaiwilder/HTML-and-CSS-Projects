# HTML and CSS Projects
A place to keep my HTML and CSS projects

I have since completed 3 websites, and many small projects as practice with html and css.

* [Academy Cinemas](bootstrap_4/academy_cinemas.html)

* [The Space Station Resort](web%20project/index.html)

* [My Portfolio Project](https://kaiwilder.github.io/)

## Academy Cinemas

This is an example home page for a movie theatre, styled using bootstrap 4. It contains bootstrap elements such as a navbar, jumbotron, form cards, and dropdowns.

## The Space Station Resort

This is an example home page for a space travel company. It is styled with CSS and includes elements such as a navbar, image containers, and a form.

## My Portfolio Site

This is my first live site, designed to showcase my experience with html and css, and includes elements such as a navbar, a video which auto plays, links to my github account, and a working form.
